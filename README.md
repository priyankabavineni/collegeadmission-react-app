**Implementation of Admin/Management Module**
The Admin or Management Module is developed to give the administrative team full control over student applications and chatbot activities. To access this module, the admin must first log in using secure credentials. Once logged in, the admin is presented with two main functionalities: Applications and Chatbot Management.
Under the Applications section, the admin has several filtering options to manage and review student submissions effectively. These options include:

**View All Applications**: Displays a complete list of all student applications.

**Search by Email**: Allows the admin to search for applications using the studentâ€™s registered email address.

**Filter by Status**: Lets the admin view applications based on their current status (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected).

**Filter by Program/Department**: Enables filtering of applications based on the selected course or department.

Using these filters, the admin can easily retrieve the required student records and take action accordingly. Once an application is reviewed, the admin has the authority to either approve or reject it. If an application is rejected, the system prompts the admin to enter a rejection reason, ensuring transparency and providing clear communication to the student.

The Chatbot Management section offers additional tools to help improve student interaction through the chatbot. This section includes:

**Top Queries**: Displays the most frequently asked questions by students. This feature helps the admin identify which topics or queries are trending and frequently searched.

**Download Chat History**: Allows the admin to download a complete record of user-bot interactions. This is helpful for auditing, reviewing previous conversations, or making improvements to the chatbot.

If students repeatedly ask questions that are not currently in the chatbot's database, this trend becomes visible through the Top Queries section. The admin can then take action by updating the chatbot database with appropriate responses to those frequently asked but unanswered queries. This proactive improvement ensures that the bot becomes smarter and more helpful over time.

Overall, the Admin Module provides a centralized and user-friendly dashboard that enables the management team to handle applications efficiently and continuously improve the chatbot experience based on user behavior and feedback.
