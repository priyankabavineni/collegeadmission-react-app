Implementation of ChatBot and User Interface
ChatBot:
The ChatBot enables users to ask any questions related to college admissions. It provides accurate and relevant responses based on the query. In cases where the user asks an unknown question or something unrelated to college admissions, the bot gracefully handles it by responding:
"Sorry, I didn't get that. Please contact admissions at 9876543210."

User Interface:
The user interface is designed to serve both the college management team and students. It offers a seamless, intuitive experience allowing easy access to the ChatBot, application forms, status tracking, and management dashboardsâ€”ensuring efficient communication and smooth administration of the college admission process.
